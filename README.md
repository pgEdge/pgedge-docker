# pgEdge Docker

This repository contains the Dockerfile used to build
[pgedge/pgedge](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/pgedge/pgedge)
on Docker Hub.

See the example commands below for running pgEdge containers in Docker. You will
need to provide a JSON configuration file that specifies the database nodes and
users.

## Examples

### Single Node

To run a single node you can use this command:

```
docker run -it --rm -p 5432:5432 \
  -v "./examples/singlenode/db.json:/home/pgedge/db.json" \
  pgedge/pgedge:pg17-latest
```

You can then log in using `psql` with the following command:

```
PGPASSWORD=uFR44yr69C4mZa72g3JQ37GX \
psql -h localhost -p 5432 -U admin defaultdb
```

And of course you should customize the user passwords before using this in
any real deployment.

### Multi-Node

A Docker Swarm example of a two node cluster is located at [examples/swarm](examples/swarm).

## Data Volumes

This image is compatible with Docker volumes and bind mounts. The configuration
for both is similar. Because PostgreSQL requires the data directory to be owned
by the user running the database, the `PGDATA` directory should be specified as
a subdirectory of the volume mount.

By default, this image uses the following approach for volume configuration:

- `/data` is the volume mount point
- `/data/pgdata` is the PostgreSQL data directory (`PGDATA`)

An example Docker compose spec that bind mounts the host folder `./n1` to the
container's `/data` folder looks like this:

```yaml
postgres-n1:
  image: pgedge/pgedge:pg17-latest
  environment:
    - 'NODE_NAME=n1'
    - 'PGDATA=/data/pgdata'
  volumes:
    - './db.json:/home/pgedge/db.json'
    - './n1:/data'
```

You can also take a look at [examples/swarm/stack.yaml](examples/swarm/stack.yaml)
for an example of using Docker volumes.

## Automatic DDL Replication

Automatically replicating DDL statements is available on an opt-in basis. To
enable this behavior, set the `autoddl:enabled` option on the database. Currently
this option must be set at the time of database creation. Changing the option
after creation is possible, but is not yet documented here.

```json
{
  "options": ["autoddl:enabled"]
}
```

See the full example JSON configuration in the
[Database Configuration](#database-configuration) section below.

The user running DDL statements must be a superuser currently in order to use
automatic DDL replication.

More information on automatic DDL replication can be found [here](https://docs.pgedge.com/platform/advanced/autoddl).

## Database Configuration

A simple JSON file is used to configure the database nodes. You can customize
this according to your needs, including adding more nodes and users. Always
remember to change the passwords!

```json
{
  "name": "defaultdb",
  "port": 5432,
  "options": ["autoddl:enabled"],
  "nodes": [
    {
      "name": "n1",
      "region": "us-east-1",
      "hostname": "postgres-n1"
    },
    {
      "name": "n2",
      "region": "us-east-2",
      "hostname": "postgres-n2"
    }
  ],
  "users": [
    {
      "username": "admin",
      "password": "uFR44yr69C4mZa72g3JQ37GX",
      "superuser": true,
      "service": "postgres",
      "type": "admin"
    },
    {
      "username": "pgedge",
      "password": "z1Zsku10a91RS526jnVrLC39",
      "superuser": true,
      "service": "postgres",
      "type": "internal_admin"
    },
    {
      "username": "pgcat_auth",
      "password": "5Y306TW24540dEnyxp3mQBwH",
      "service": "postgres",
      "type": "pooler_auth"
    },
    {
      "username": "pgcat_admin",
      "password": "k6uu4od8r0P6lA11Oep648KC",
      "service": "pgcat",
      "type": "other"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Spock Notes

When the container runs, the [Spock](https://github.com/pgedge/spock) extension
is created and replication subscriptions are _automatically created_.

If you do not use automatic DDL replication as described above, you can instead
use the `spock.replicate_ddl` function to manually replicate DDL statements.
For example:

```sql
SELECT spock.replicate_ddl('CREATE TABLE public.users (id uuid, name text, PRIMARY KEY (id))');
```

The `users` table will now exist _on all nodes_. Now you can add the table to the
default replication set by executing this command on all nodes:

```sql
SELECT spock.repset_add_all_tables('default', ARRAY['public']);
```
